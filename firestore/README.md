# Google Cloud Firestore Code Sample

This sample demonstrates how to use [Google Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) on [Google App Engine Standard Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine).

## Getting the sample code

Run the following command to clone the Github repository:

    git clone https://github.com/ryanmats/gcp-hackathon-demos.git

Change directory to the sample code location:

    cd gcp-hackathon-demos/firestore

## Firebase Setup

Open the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.

On the left navigation bar, click 'Develop', then click 'Database', then click 'Create Database'.

Click the button for 'Start in test mode', then click 'Enable'.

On the left navigation bar at the top, click 'Project Overview'.

Under 'Get started by adding Firebase to your app', click the '</>' button. This will help you add Firebase to your web app.

Copy everything from the 'var config = {' line down to the '};' line.

In the 'templates/homepage.html' code file, find the '// Firebase Configuration - REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN VALUES' comment and replace the existing config values with your own config values that you just copied from the Firebase console. Make sure to fix the spacing.

In the 'templates/dashboard.html' code file, find the '// Firebase Configuration - REPLACE WITH YOUR OWN VALUES' comment and replace the existing config values with your own config values that you just copied from the Firebase console. Make sure to fix the spacing.

## Cloud Firestore Database Preparation

In the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), click 'Database' on the left navigation bar.

Click 'Add Collection' and give your collection the name 'answers'. Click Next. Next you will create your first document for this collection. Set the 'Document id' to be 'sunsetPhoto'. Name your field 'answers' and change the type to 'array'. Then add a few array values like 'sunset', 'beach', 'ocean', and 'tree'. These will be your sample correct answers for the app. Click 'Save' to create your new collection.

Click 'Add Collection' again and create an new collection with the name 'scores'. Click Next. For your first document for this collection, set the 'Document id' to be 'groupScore'. Name your field 'correct', change its type to 'number', and set its value to be 0. Click the '+' button to create another field named 'incorrect', with type of 'number', and a value of 0. Click 'Save' to create your new collection.

Congrats! Your Cloud Firestore database is all set up for this sample app.

## Running Locally

Set up your virtual environment:

    virtualenv env

Note: If you do not already have `virtualenv` installed, run 'sudo easy_install pip' and then 'pip install virtualenv'.

Enter your virtual environment:

    source env/bin/activate

Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Test your application locally:

    python main.py

Visit `localhost:8080` to view your application running locally. The root URL is where users play the game and guess which labels the Cloud Vision API detected for the photo. Visit `localhost:8080/dashboard` to view the dashboard for a summary of scores and guesses and a demonstration of the realtime aspect of the app.

Press `Control-C` from command line when you are finished.

When you are ready to leave your virtual environment:

    deactivate

## Deploying to App Engine

Download the [Google Cloud SDK command line tool](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/downloads#interactive), also known as `gcloud`.

Initialize gcloud, selecting your Google account and project ID (the same one you created in the Firebase console):

    gcloud init

Deploy your application to App Engine (takes 10-20 seconds).

    gcloud app deploy

Once it finishes deploying, visit your app at YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com and YOUR_PROJECT_ID.appspot.com/dashboard.
